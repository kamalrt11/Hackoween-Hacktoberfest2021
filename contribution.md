# Contribution rules to follow:

1. Ensure that the code added is valid and executable.
2. Addition of comments is necessary. If comments are not added, they will be labeled with "Enhancement needed".
3. In the case of standard DSA algorithms like linked lists and operations on them, make sure to add time and space complexity.
4. If it is the solution of a DSA related question, add the question along with the time and space complexity
5. If it is a template, each upload for a template **MUST** be in its own folder in the parent directory
6. Spam additions like white space corrections and gramatical changes and insignificant code additions will be consided and labeled as **SPAM**
