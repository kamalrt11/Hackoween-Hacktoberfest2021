# Rules To Follow while sending pull request:
-Read contribution.md before proceeding.
- Please follow the file structure given, i.e Put your code in the respective folders only. Example if you want to add a data structure in cpp language do it in the specific folder. If you prefer in another language make a new folder (if not already present) and follow the same file structure there. 
- Do not push spam codes (They should be proper codes and not just one liners or space fixes).
- Please try to add extended descriptions about the code you are adding.
- Single line commits will be closed and will be marked as spam.
- **For DSA Code**:
    Try to add time and space complexity to the actual code as comments.
